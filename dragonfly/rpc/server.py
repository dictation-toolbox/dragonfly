RPC server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dragonfly's RPC server handles requests by processing each method through
the current engine's :ref:`multiplexing timer interface <RefEngineTimers>`.
This allows engines to handle requests safely and keeps engine-specific
implementation details out of the *dragonfly.rpc* sub-package.

Security tokens
============================================================================

The RPC server uses mandatory security tokens to authenticate client
requests. This avoids some security issues where, for example, malicious web
pages could send POST requests to the server, even if running on localhost.

If sending requests over an open network, please ensure that the connection
is secure by using TLS or SSH port forwarding.

If the server's :code:`security_token` constructor parameter is not
specified, a new token will be generated and printed to the console. Clients
must specify the security token either as the last positional argument or as
the :code:`security_token` keyword argument.

Errors will be raised if clients send no security token or a token that
doesn't match the server's.

    RPC server class.

    This class will run a local web server on port 50051 by default. The
    server expects requests using
    `JSON-RPC 2.0 <https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`__.

    Constructor arguments:

    - *address* -- address to use (*str*, default: "127.0.0.1")
    - *port* -- port to use (*int*, default: 50051)
    - *ssl_context* -- SSL context object to pass to
      *werkzeug.serving.run_simple* (*SSLContext*, default: None).
    - *threaded* -- whether to use a separate thread to process each request
      (*bool*, default: True).
    - *security_token* -- security token for authenticating clients
      (*str*, default: None). A new token will be generated and printed if
      this parameter is unspecified.

    The *ssl_context* parameter is explained in more detail in Werkzeug's
    `SSL serving documentation
    <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.14/serving/#ssl>`__.

    Secure connections can also be set up using OpenSSH port forwarding with
    a command such as::

        $ ssh -NTf -L 50051:127.0.0.1:50051 <system-with-rpc-server>

    *Minor note*: using an IP address instead of a hostname for the
    *address* parameter should increase performance somewhat, e.g.
    "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost".

    .. warning::

       Do **not** send requests to the server from the main engine thread;
       thread deadlocks *will* occur if you do this because the main thread
       cannot call timer functions and wait for a response at the same time.
       The RPC framework was designed to be used from *remote* processes.

       Requests will not be processed if the engine is not connected and
       processing speech.
