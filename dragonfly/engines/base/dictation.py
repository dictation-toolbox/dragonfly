Dictation container base class
============================================================================

This class is used to store the recognized results of dictation elements 
within voice-commands.  It offers access to both the raw spoken-form words 
and be formatted written-form text.

The formatted text can be retrieved using
:meth:`~DictationContainerBase.format` or simply by  calling ``str(...)``
on a dictation container object. A tuple of the raw  spoken words can be
retrieved using :attr:`~DictationContainerBase.words`.

#  of dictated words.

        :class:`Dictation` element.

        This base class implements the general functionality of dictation 
        container classes.  Each supported engine should have a derived 
        dictation container class which performs the actual engine-
        specific formatting of dictated text.
