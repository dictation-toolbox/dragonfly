Dictation container base class
============================================================================

This class is used to store the recognized results of dictation elements
within voice-commands.  It offers access to both the raw spoken-form words
and be formatted written-form text.

The object can be expected to behave like a string,
responding as you would expect to string methods like :meth:`replace`.
The formatted text can be retrieved using
:meth:`~DictationContainerBase.format` or simply by  calling ``str(...)``
on a dictation container object.
By default, formatting returns the words joined with
spaces, but custom formatting can be applied by calling
string methods on the :class:`Dictation` object.
A tuple of the raw  spoken words can be
retrieved using :attr:`~DictationContainerBase.words`.
