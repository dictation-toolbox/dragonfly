Multiplexing interface to the Natlink timer

    Timer manager for the Natlink engine.

    This class utilises :meth:`natlink.setTimerCallback` to ensure that
    timer functions are called on-time regardless of Dragon's current
    status.

    Python code run outside of timer functions will be blocked when
    ``natlink`` functions are executing. This is a
    `limitation with Python threads
    <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#thread-state-and-the-global-interpreter-lock>`__.

    :meth:`engine.connect` must be called before using timers with this
    manager.

    **Note**: long-running timers will block dragonfly from processing
    what was said, so be careful with how you use them!
