class ContextAction(ActionBase):
    '''
    Action class to execute a different action depending on which context is
    currently active.

    This is especially useful for allowing the same commands to work in
    multiple applications without redefining them in other grammars. An
    example of this is the redo shortcut. Some applications use
    *Ctrl+Shift+Z*, while others might use *Ctrl+Y* instead.
    ``ContextAction`` could be used to define *Ctrl+Y* as the default and
    use *Ctrl+Shift+Z* for specific contexts::

        redo = ContextAction(default=Key('c-y'), actions=[
            # Use cs-z for rstudio
            (AppContext(executable="rstudio"), Key('cs-z')),
        ])

    This class was originally written for the
    `Aenea <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea>`__ project by Alex
    Roper and has been modified to work without Aenea's functionality.
