BringApp and StartApp actions
============================================================================

The :class:`StartApp` and :class:`BringApp` action classes are used to 
start an application and bring it to the foreground.  :class:`StartApp` 
starts an application by running an executable file, while 
:class:`BringApp` first checks whether the application is already running 
and if so brings it to the foreground, otherwise starts it by running the 
executable file.


Example usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following example brings Notepad to the foreground if it is already 
open, otherwise it starts Notepad::

   BringApp(r"C:\Windows\system32\\notepad.exe").execute()

Note that the path to *notepad.exe* given above might not be correct for 
your computer, since it depends on the operating system and its 
configuration.

In some cases an application might be accessible simply through the file 
name of its executable, without specifying the directory.  This depends on 
the operating system's path configuration.  For example, on the author's 
computer the following command successfully starts Notepad::

   BringApp("notepad").execute()
