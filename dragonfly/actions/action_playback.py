Playback action
============================================================================

The :class:`Playback` action mimics a sequence of recognitions.  This is 
for example useful for repeating a series of prerecorded or predefined 
voice-commands.

This class could for example be used to reload with one single action::

    action = Playback([
                       (["focus", "Natlink"], 1.0),
                       (["File"], 0.5),
                       (["Reload"], 0.0),
                     ])
    action.execute()
