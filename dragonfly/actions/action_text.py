"""
Text action
============================================================================

This section describes the :class:`Text` action object. This type of 
action is used for typing text into the foreground application.

It differs from the :class:`Key` action in that :class:`Text` is used for 
typing literal text, while :class:`dragonfly.actions.action_key.Key` 
emulates pressing keys on the keyboard.  An example of this is that the 
arrow-keys are not part of a text and so cannot be typed using the 
:class:`Text` action, but can be sent by the 
:class:`dragonfly.actions.action_key.Key` action.
