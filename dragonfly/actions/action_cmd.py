RunCommand action
============================================================================

The :class:`RunCommand` action takes a command-line program to run including
any required arguments. On execution, the program will be started as a
subprocess.

Processing will occur asynchronously by default. Commands running
asynchronously should not normally prevent the Python process from exiting.

It may sometimes be necessary to use a list for the action's *command*
argument instead of a string. This is because some command-line shells may
not work 100% correctly with Python's built-in :meth:`shlex.split` function.

This action should work on Windows and other platforms.

Example using the ping command::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    # Ping localhost for 4 seconds.
    RunCommand('ping -w 4 localhost').execute()


Example using a command list instead of a string::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    # Ping localhost for 4 seconds.
    RunCommand(['ping', '-w', '4', 'localhost']).execute()


Example using the optional function parameter::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    def func(proc):
        # Read lines from the process.
        for line in iter(proc.stdout.readline, b''):
            print(line)

    RunCommand('ping -w 4 localhost', func).execute()


Example using the optional synchronous parameter::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    RunCommand('ping -w 4 localhost', synchronous=True).execute()


Example using the subprocess's :class:`Popen` object::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    # Initialise and execute a command asynchronously.
    cmd = RunCommand('ping -w 4 localhost')
    cmd.execute()

    # Wait until the subprocess finishes.
    cmd.process.wait()


Example using a subclass::

    from dragonfly import RunCommand

    class Ping(RunCommand):
        command = "ping -w 4 localhost"
        synchronous = True
        def process_command(self, proc):
            # Read lines from the process.
            for line in iter(proc.stdout.readline, b''):
                print(line)

    Ping().execute()
