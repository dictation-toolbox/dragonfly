Mimic action

class Mimic(ActionBase):
    """
        Mimic recognition action.

        The constructor arguments are the words which will be mimicked. 
        These should be passed as a variable argument list.  For example::

            action = Mimic("hello", "world", r"!\\exclamation-mark")
            action.execute()

        If an error occurs during mimicking the given recognition, then an 
        *ActionError* is raised.  A common error is that the engine does 
        not know the given words and can therefore not recognize them. 
        For example, the following attempts to mimic recognition of *one 
        single word* including a space and an exclamation-mark; this will 
        almost certainly fail::

            Mimic("hello world!").execute()   # Will raise ActionError.

        The constructor accepts the optional *extra* keyword argument, and 
        uses this to retrieve dynamic data from the extras associated with 
        the recognition.  For example, this can be used as follows to 
        implement dynamic mimicking::

            class ExampleRule(MappingRule):
                mapping  = {
                            "mimic recognition <text> [<n> times]":
                                Mimic(extra="text") * Repeat(extra="n"),
                           }
                extras   = [
                            IntegerRef("n", 1, 10),
                            Dictation("text"),
                           ]
                defaults = {
                            "n": 1,
                           }

        The example above will allow the user to speak **"mimic 
        recognition hello world! 3 times"**, which would result in the 
        exact same output as if the user had spoken **"hello world!"** 
        three times in a row.
