        Wait for a specific window context action.

        Constructor arguments:
         - *title* (*str*) --
           part of the window title: not case sensitive
         - *executable* (*str*) --
           part of the file name of the executable; not case sensitive
         - *timeout* (*int* or *float*) --
           the maximum number of seconds to wait for the correct
           context, after which an :class:`ActionError` will
           be raised.

        When this action is executed, it waits until the correct window 
        context is present.  This window context is specified by the 
        desired window title of the foreground window and/or the 
        executable name of the foreground application.  These are 
        specified using the constructor arguments listed above.  The 
        substring search used is *not* case sensitive.

        If the correct window context is not found within *timeout* 
        seconds, then this action will raise an :class:`ActionError` to 
        indicate the timeout.
