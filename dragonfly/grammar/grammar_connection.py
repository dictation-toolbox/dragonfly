        Grammar class for maintaining a COM connection well 
        within a given context.  This is useful for controlling 
        applications through COM while they are in the 
        foreground.  This grammar class will take care of 
        dispatching the correct COM interface when the 
        application comes to the foreground, and releasing it 
        when the application is no longer there.

         * ``name`` -- name of this grammar.
         * ``description`` -- description for this grammar.
         * ``context`` -- context within which to maintain
           the COM connection.
         * ``app_name`` -- COM name to dispatch.
