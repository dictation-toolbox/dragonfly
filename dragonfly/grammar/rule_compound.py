"""
CompoundRule class
============================================================================

The CompoundRule class is designed to make it very easy to create a rule 
based on a single compound spec.

This rule class has the following parameters to customize its behavior:

 - *spec* -- compound specification for the rule's root element
 - *extras* -- extras elements referenced from the compound spec
 - *defaults* -- default values for the extras
 - *exported* -- whether the rule is exported
 - *context* -- context in which the rule will be active

Each of these parameters can be passed as a (keyword) arguments to the 
constructor, or defined as a class attribute in a derived class.


Example usage
............................................................................

The CompoundRule class can be used to define a voice-command as follows::

    class ExampleRule(CompoundRule):

        spec = "I want to eat <food>"
        extras = [Choice("food", {
                                  "(an | a juicy) apple": "good",
                                  "a [greasy] hamburger": "bad",
                                 }
                        )
                 ]

        def _process_recognition(self, node, extras):
            good_or_bad = extras["food"]
            print "That is a %s idea!" % good_or_bad

    rule = ExampleRule()
    grammar.add_rule(rule)
