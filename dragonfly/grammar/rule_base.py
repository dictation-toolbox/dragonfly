        Rule class for implementing complete or partial voice-commands.

        This rule class represents a voice-command or part of a voice-
        command.  It contains a root element, which defines the language
        construct of this rule.

        Constructor arguments:
         - *name* (*str*) -- name of this rule.  If *None*, a unique
           name will automatically be generated.
         - *element* (*Element*) --
           root element for this rule
         - *context* (*Context*, default: *None*) --
           context within which to be active.  If *None*, the rule will
           always be active when its grammar is active.
         - *imported* (boolean, default: *False*) --
           if true, this rule is imported from outside its grammar
         - *exported* (boolean, default: *False*) --
           if true, this rule is a complete top-level rule which can be
           spoken by the user.  This should be *True* for voice-commands
           that the user can speak.

        The *self._log* logger objects should be used in methods of
        derived classes for logging purposes.  It is a standard logger
        object from the *logger* module in the Python standard library.
