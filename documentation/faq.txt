General Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Dragonfly?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dragonfly is a speech recognition framework for Python that makes it
convenient to create custom commands to use with speech recognition
software.  It was written to make it very easy for Python macros, scripts,
and applications to interface with speech recognition engines.  Its design
allows speech commands and grammar objects to be treated as first-class
Python objects.

Dragonfly can be used for general programming by voice.  It is flexible
enough to allow programming in any language, not just Python.  It can also
be used for speech-enabling applications, automating computer activities and
dictating prose.


Which speech recognition software and operating systems are supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dragonfly supports the following speech recognition (SR) engines:

* :ref:`Dragon <RefNatlinkEngine>`, a product of *Nuance*. All versions up
  to 15 (the latest) are supported. *Home*, *Professional Individual* and
  previous similar editions of *Dragon* are supported. Other editions may
  work too
* :ref:`Windows Speech Recognition <RefSapi5Engine>` (WSR), included with
  Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows 7+, and freely available for Windows XP
* :ref:`Kaldi <RefKaldiEngine>`
* :ref:`CMU Pocket Sphinx <RefSphinxEngine>`

Dragonfly has cross platform support for Windows, macOS and Linux
(X11-only).  The following table shows which engines are available on which
platforms:

================================     =======================
Operating system                     Available SR engines
================================     =======================
Windows                              DNS, WSR, Kaldi, Sphinx
Linux                                Kaldi, Sphinx
macOS                                Kaldi, Sphinx
================================     =======================

Windows-only speech recognition software (DNS and WSR) may be used to
control Linux or macOS machines via `Aenea`_, a client-server library for
using Dragonfly voice macros on remote hosts.

Dragonfly's X11 support is dependent on the external *xdotool*, *wmctrl*
and *xsel* programs.  These programs are available for most Linux
distributions.  They are also available for other operating systems, such as
FreeBSD.  At present, since *xdotool* is not available for it, Dragonfly
will not work properly in a Cygwin environment.


Where can I find examples Dragonfly command modules?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a list of repositories and other projects containing Dragonfly
command modules under the :ref:`RefRelatedResources` ->
:ref:`RefCommandModulesList` section of the documentation. There are also
example command modules in `dragonfly/examples`_.


What is the difference between dragonfly and dragonfly2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Dragonfly* is the `original project`_ written by Christo Butcher.  It is no
longer maintained.  *Dragonfly2* is a `fork`_ of Dragonfly that uses a
different *distribution* name.

It is important to note that the *import name* is still "dragonfly":

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import Grammar, MappingRule, Key, Text, Mouse, Dictation

Dragonfly2 is intended to be backwards-compatible continuation of the
original project.  Many problems are fixed in this version.  It supports
alternative speech recognition engine backends (e.g. the
:ref:`Kaldi engine <RefKaldiEngine>`), works with Python 3 and has
cross-support for macOS and the X Window System (X11).  Dragonfly2 also has
some new features not found in the old version.

See the :ref:`changelog <RefChangelog>` for the full list of changes between
the two versions.


How can I use older Dragonfly scripts written for Python 2.7?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version of Dragonfly has been written with backwards-compatibility in
mind.  Older Dragonfly scripts, many of which were written with Python
version 2 in mind, will either work perfectly without any changes or will
after minor changes.

Although Python version 2.7 reached the end of its life in January 2020,
Dragonfly has, for the most part, retained support for it.  This has been
done because the library has always supported Python 2 and because retaining
this support is, at present, neither difficult nor detrimental to the
library's support for Python version 3.  The Kaldi engine back-end is the
one (optional) component of Dragonfly that requires Python version 3.

If the reader must use Python 3, then the Python 2 code typically needs to
be converted.  The following two command-line programs may be used to this
end:

* `2to3`_ - reads Python 2 source code and applies a series of fixers to
  transform it into valid Python 3 code.
* `python-modernize`_ - uses *2to3* to make Python 2 code compatible with
  Python 3.

The `Python 2-3 code porting guide`_ may also be of interest.

A number of older Dragonfly command modules also include the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       import pkg_resources
       pkg_resources.require("dragonfly >= 0.6.5")
   except ImportError:
       pass

Since the distribution name has been changed to *dragonfly2*,
:code:`dragonfly` will need to be replaced with :code:`dragonfly2`.


Where are some good resources on learning Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use Dragonfly for flexible computer control or for
programming in other languages and don't have much knowledge of Python, then
the following resources from might be of use:

* `Beginner's Guide for non-programmers
  <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers>`__

* `Beginner's Guide for programmers
  <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers>`__

* `The Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html>`__

* `Latest Python documentation <https://docs.python.org>`__


API Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I use an "extra" in a Dragonfly spec multiple times?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is desirable to use the same "extra" multiple times in a
Dragonfly :code:`Compound`, :code:`CompoundRule` or :code:`MappingRule`
specification (or "spec").  Unfortunately, this is not directly possible.
But, the special :code:`RuleWrap` element may be utilized to reference an
"extra" multiple times.  See the following example:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import (Choice, RuleWrap, RuleRef, Key, MappingRule,
                          Grammar)

   # Define a Choice for matching "alpha", "bravo" or "charlie".
   my_choice = Choice("", {
       "alpha": "a",
       "bravo": "b",
       "charlie": "c"
   })

   # Use *my_choice* to make a private rule using RuleWrap.
   my_choice_rule = RuleWrap("", my_choice).rule

   # Define *Letter1* and *Letter2* as references to the new rule.
   alpha_extras = [
       RuleRef(my_choice_rule, "Letter1"),
       RuleRef(my_choice_rule, "Letter2")
   ]

   # Define a command for typing two letters separated by a space.
   mapping = {
       "<Letter1> and <Letter2>": Key("%(Letter1)s, space, %(Letter2)s")
   }

   # Create a new grammar with this command and load it.
   grammar = Grammar("letters")
   grammar.add_rule(MappingRule(mapping=mapping, extras=alpha_extras))
   grammar.load()


Is there a way to re-use a function with different "extra" names?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dragonfly's :class:`Function` action class is normally used to call a Python
function when a spoken command is recognized.  :class:`Function` actions
pass recognized "extra" values via key word arguments, rather than
positional arguments.

Below are two methods to re-use a Python function without redefining
it:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import Function

   # Define a function to be used by two Function actions.
   def add_and_print(x, y):
       print("%d" % (x + y))

   # --- Method one ---
   # Use a lambda function.
   Function(lambda x, z: add_and_print(x, z))

   # --- Method two ---
   # Use the optional 'remap_data' argument to pass the 'z' argument
   # as 'y' internally.
   Function(add_and_print, dict(z='y'))


See the :ref:`Function action's documentation <RefFunctionAction>`
for more information and code examples.


Is there a way to recognize negative integers with Dragonfly?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes.  The simplest way of recognizing negative integers is to use
:class:`IntegerRef` and :class:`Modifier` elements together in a command
with an appropriate prefix word such as "negative" or "minus":

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import IntegerRef, Modifier, Text

   # Define a MappingRule command for typing a negative integer.
   mapping = {
       "(minus|negative) <n>": Text("%(n)d"),
   }

   # The special Modifier element lets us modify the value of an element.
   #  Here we use it to specify the "n" extra as a negated integer between 1
   #  and 50.
   extras = [
       Modifier(IntegerRef("n", 1, 50), lambda n: n*-1)
   ]


Is there a way to construct Dragonfly grammars manually with elements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes.  The :class:`dragonfly.grammar.rule_basic.BasicRule` is the rule class
to use for constructing Dragonfly rules and grammars manually with elements
instead of with compound specs and extras.

The following is an example of how to use :class:`BasicRule` and common
Dragonfly element and action classes together:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import (BasicRule, Repetition, Alternative, Literal, Text,
                          Grammar)

   class ExampleRule(BasicRule):
       # Define a rule element that accepts 1 to 5 (exclusive) repetitions
       #  of either 'test one', 'test two' or 'test three'.  These commands
       #  type their respective numbers in succession using the Text action.
       element = Repetition(
           Alternative((
               Literal("test one", value=Text("1")),
               Literal("test two", value=Text("2")),
               Literal("test three", value=Text("3")),
           )),
           1, 5
       )

   # Create a grammar with the example rule and load it.
   rule = ExampleRule()
   grammar = Grammar("BasicRule Example")
   grammar.add_rule(rule)
   grammar.load()


Please note that extras in action specification strings (e.g. *n* in
:code:`Key("left:%(n)d")`) will **not** work for the :class:`BasicRule`
class.  For this functionality, a :class:`CompoundRule` or
:class:`MappingRule` must be used.  See the :ref:`RefRuleClasses` section
for more information.


Does Dragonfly support using Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) with the GUI?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. To use WSR with the GUI, specify "sapi5shared" as the engine name.

In a command-module or loader program:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import get_engine
   get_engine("sapi5shared")

On the command-line::

  python -m dragonfly load -e sapi5shared _notepad_example.py

You may experience problems using Dragonfly and WSR this way.


Is there an easy way to check which speech recognition engine is in use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. The current engine can be checked using the
:py:meth:`dragonfly.engines.get_current_engine` function. The following code
prints the name of the current engine if one has been initialized:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import get_current_engine
   engine = get_current_engine()
   if engine:
       print("Engine name: %r" % engine.name)
   else:
       print("No engine has been initialized.")


Troubleshooting Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are my command modules are not being loaded/detected?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have placed Python files into the *MacroSystem* / user directory
(using DNS/Natlink) or the directory where your module loader script is
(using another engine) and there is no indication that the files were
loaded, then there can be a few reasons why:

#. Your Python files don't start with an underscore `_` and end with
   `.py`.

#. You've put the files in the wrong directory.
   If you're using Natlink, then try running the Natlink configuration-
   program to double check where Natlink loads files from.

In the case that your command modules are being loaded and you're getting
error messages not mentioned in the FAQ, then see the
:ref:`RefFAQUnansweredQuestions` section.


How do I fix "No handlers could be found for logger X" error messages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error is specific to Python 2. It isn't a Dragonfly error, but as many
Dragonfly users still use Python 2, it is listed here.  This is one common
example of the error: ::

  No handlers could be found for logger "action"

There are two easy methods for to solving this problem:

.. code-block:: python

   # --- Method one ---
   # Set up a basic logging handler for console output using the 'logging'
   # module.
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig()

   # --- Method two ---
   # Set up Dragonfly's logging handler from the 'dragonfly.log' module.
   # This sets up a logging handler for console output, appends log messages
   # to a log file (~/.dragonfly.log) and sets sane defaults for Dragonfly's
   # internal loggers.
   from dragonfly.log import setup_log
   setup_log()

For either method, add the two lines of code near the top of one of your
command modules, or command module loader script, if you use one.


Cannot load compatibility module support error when starting Dragon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a known issue with Natlink. Please see this
`Natlink troubleshooting page`_ for solutions on how to solve this and other
issues that occur before the Natlink messages window appears.


How do I run a GUI when using Natlink?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common GUI libraries will not function in modules loaded by Natlink.  To
sidestep this issue, write the GUI as an independent program and start it
via the built-in :code:`subprocess` module.


How do I fix "failed to decode recognition" errors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Failed to decode recognition" is the error message displayed when Dragonfly
is unable to match what was said to a grammar rule.  One way around this
problem to add an "extra" for reserved words:

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import Choice, Text

   mapping = {
       "reserved <reserved>": Text("%(reserved)s")
   }

   extras = [
       Choice("reserved", {
           "alpha": "alpha",
           "bravo": "bravo",
           "charlie": "charlie",
       })
   ]


How can I increase the speech recognition accuracy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Low recognition accuracy is usually caused by either bad-quality audio input
or a speech model that isn't trained to your voice or use case. You might
try the following:

 * Re-positioning your microphone.
 * Using a different microphone.
 * Training words or phrases.
 * Change the speech recognition engine settings (e.g. adjust Dragon's
   accuracy/speed slider).
 * Using a different engine back-end if possible, e.g. the Kaldi back-end is
   typically more accurate than CMU Pocket Sphinx and WSR back-ends.

Dragonfly also has programmatic methods for increasing recognition accuracy.
They can be used to fine tune accuracy for specific commands or parts of
commands:

 #. :ref:`Kaldi Grammar/Rule/Element Weights <RefKaldiEngineWeights>`
    (Kaldi-only)
 #. Quoted words in :class:`dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Literal`
    elements (Dragon-only)


Why isn't Dragonfly code aware of DPI scaling settings on Windows?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There can be problems with the mouse action on Windows Vista and above if
the system is set up to use one or more monitors with a high number of dots
per inch (DPI).  For this reason, Dragonfly attempts to set the DPI
awareness for the process when it is imported.

If you need to set the DPI awareness manually using a different DPI
awareness value, do so before importing Dragonfly.  The following is
essentially what Dragonfly does internally on Windows 8.1 and above:

.. code-block:: python

   import ctypes
   ctypes.windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(2)  # PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE

For more information, please see Microsoft's own documentation:

* `High DPI Desktop Application Development on Windows`_
* `Setting the default DPI awareness for a process`_


How to use Dragonfly actions with administrative applications on Windows?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not normally possible to interact with applications running in
elevated mode.  The recommended way to do so is to use Dragon's built-in
commands, which can interact with such applications.

The :code:`Key`, :code:`Text` and :code:`Mouse` action classes may be
configured to send input events via Natlink to Dragon.  To enable this
feature, run the following code, or add it into one of your command modules:

  .. code-block:: python

     # Enable sending keyboard events via Natlink to Dragon.
     from dragonfly.actions.keyboard import Keyboard
     Keyboard.try_natlink = True

     # Enable sending mouse events via Natlink to Dragon.
     from dragonfly.actions.mouse import ButtonEvent
     ButtonEvent.try_natlink = True

If you are not using Dragon, or if you want to use your own commands instead
of the built-ins, try running the appropriate command-module loader script
in `dragonfly/examples`_ as the administrator.


Why aren't Dragonfly's input actions working on my Linux system?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dragonfly's :code:`Key`, :code:`Text` and :code:`Mouse` action classes use
the `xdotool`_ program on Linux.  These actions will not work if it isn't
installed.  It can normally be installed through your system's package
manager. On Debian-based or Ubuntu-based systems, this is done by running
the following console command::

  sudo apt install xdotool

The :code:`Window` class also requires the `wmctrl`_ program::

  sudo apt install wmctrl

The keyboard and mouse input classes on Linux (or similar) systems will only
work in an X11 session.  The following error will occur if these classes are
used under `Wayland`_::

  NotImplementedError: Keyboard support is not implemented for this platform!

Wayland users are recommended to either, `switch to X11`_, or to use Windows
or macOS instead.  You might also consider using `numen`_, a different voice
control system with excellent Linux support.

If you are using X11 and still see this message, it means that the
:code:`DISPLAY` environment variable has not been set.
