Installation
============================================================================

This section describes how to install Dragonfly.  The 
installation procedure of Dragonfly itself is straightforward. 
Its dependencies, however, differ depending on which speech 
recognition engine is used.


Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to use the dragonfly, you will need the following:

 * **Python** -- available from the `Python dowloads page
   <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
   **Version 2.7 (32-bit) is required if using Natlink**.
 * **Win32 extensions for Python** *(only for Windows users)* --
   available from the `pywin32 releases page
   <https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases>`_.
 * **Natlink** *(only for Dragon users)* -- latest
   versions available from `SourceForge
   <https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlinktest4.1/>`_.
 * `wmctrl <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/wmctrl/>`__, `xdotool
   <https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/>`__ and `xsel
   <http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/>`__ programs *(only
   for Linux/X11 users)* -- usually available from your system's package
   manager.

**Note on Python 2.7**: Python version 2.7 (32-bit) is required if using the
Natlink engine back-end, at least for the moment.  Support for this version
is not maintained for the other engine back-ends and will be **dropped
completely** in the first *MAJOR* release following stable Natlink support
for Python 3.

**Note for Linux users**: Dragonfly is only fully functional in an X11
session.  You may also need to manually set the ``DISPLAY`` environment
variable.  Input action classes, application contexts and the ``Window``
class will **not** be functional under Wayland.  It is recommended that
Wayland users switch to X11.


Installation of Dragonfly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragonfly is a Python package. It can be installed as *dragonfly2* using
pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip install dragonfly2

The distribution name has been changed to *dragonfly2* in order to
upload releases to PyPI.org, but everything can still be imported using
*dragonfly*. If you use any grammar modules that include something like
:code:`pkg_resources.require("dragonfly >= 0.6.5")`, you will need to either
replace :code:`dragonfly` with :code:`dragonfly2` or remove lines like this
altogether.

If you wish to install the latest release candidate for version 1.0.0,
please run the following command instead:

.. code:: shell

    pip install dragonfly2==1.0.0-rc2

These versions are more up-to-date and have fewer requirements.  The
documentation for them is available at `Read the Docs (latest)
<http://dragonfly2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

If you have dragonfly installed under the original *dragonfly*
distribution name, you'll need to remove the old version using:

.. code:: shell

    pip uninstall dragonfly

Dragonfly can also be installed by cloning this repository or
downloading it from `the releases
page <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly/releases>`__ and running
the following (or similar) command in the project's root directory:

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py install

If pip fails to install *dragonfly2* or any of its required or extra
dependencies, then you may need to upgrade pip with the following command:

.. code:: shell

    pip install --upgrade pip


Installation for specific SR engine back-ends
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Dragonfly speech recognition engine back-end and its requirements are
documented separately:

* :ref:`RefNatlinkEngine`
* :ref:`RefSapi5Engine`
* :ref:`RefKaldiEngine`
* :ref:`RefSphinxEngine`
* :ref:`RefTextEngine`
