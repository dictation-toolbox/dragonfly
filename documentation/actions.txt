Actions sub-package
============================================================================

The Dragonfly library contains an action framework which offers easy and 
flexible interfaces to common actions, such as sending keystrokes and 
emulating speech recognition.  Dragonfly's actions sub-package has various 
types of these actions, each consisting of a Python class.  There is for 
example a :class:`dragonfly.actions.action_key.Key` class for sending 
keystrokes and a :class:`dragonfly.actions.action_mimic.Mimic` class for 
emulating speech recognition.

Each of these actions is implemented as a Python class and this makes it 
easy to work with them.  An action can be created (*defined what it will 
do*) at one point and executed (*do what it was defined to do*) later. 
Actions can be added together with the ``+`` operator to attend them 
together, thereby creating series of actions.

Perhaps the most important method of Dragonfly's actions is their 
:meth:`dragonfly.actions.action_base.ActionBase.execute` method, which 
performs the actual event associated with its action.

Dragonfly's action types are derived from the 
:class:`dragonfly.actions.action_base.ActionBase` class.  This base class 
implements standard action behavior, such as the ability to concatenate 
multiple actions and to duplicate an action.


Basic examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code below shows the basic usage of Dragonfly action objects.  They 
can be created, combined, executed, etc.

.. code-block:: python

   from dragonfly import Key, Text

   a1 = Key("up, left, down, right")   # Define action a1.
   a1.execute()                        # Send the keystrokes.

   a2 = Text("Hello world!")           # Define action a2, which
                                       #  will type the text.
   a2.execute()                        # Send the keystrokes.

   a4 = a1 + a2                        # a4 is now the concatenation
                                       #  of a1 and a2.
   a4.execute()                        # Send the keystrokes.

   a3 = Key("a-f, down/25:4")          # Press alt-f and then down 4 times
                                       #  with 25/100 s pause in between.
   a4 += a3                            # a4 is now the concatenation
                                       #  of a1, a2, and a3.
   a4.execute()                        # Send the keystrokes.

   Key("w-b, right/25:5").execute()    # Define and execute together.


More examples

please see the doctests for the
:class:`dragonfly.actions.action_base.ActionBase` here:
:ref:`RefActionsDocTests`.


Combining voice commands and actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common use of Dragonfly is to control other applications by 
voice and to automate common desktop activities.  To do this, 
voice commands can be associated with actions.  When the command 
is spoken, the action is executed.  Dragonfly's action framework 
allows for easy definition of things to do, such as text input 
and sending keystrokes.  It also allows these things to be 
dynamically coupled to voice commands, so as to enable the 
actions to contain dynamic elements from the recognized command.

An example would be a voice command to find some bit of text:

 * Command specification: ``please find <text>``
 * Associated action: ``Key("c-f") + Text("%(text)s")``
 * Special element: ``Dictation("text")``

This triplet would allow the user to say *"please find some 
words"*, which would result in *control-f* being pressed to open 
the *Find* dialogue followed by *"some words"* being typed into 
the dialog.  The *special element* is necessary to define
what the dynamic element *"text"* is.
