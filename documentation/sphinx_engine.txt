CMU Pocket Sphinx engine back-end
============================================================================

Dragonfly is able to use the open source CMU Pocket Sphinx speech
recognition engine as an alternative to DNS/Natlink, Kaldi and WSR.
The engine has a few limitations (documented below), and is generally
not as accurate as the others, but it does work well enough.

The CMU Pocket Sphinx engine may be used on Windows, macOS, Linux.
Dragonfly has good support for desktop enviroments on each of these
operating systems.  As other sections of the documentation mention,
Dragonfly does not support Wayland.

**Sections:**

* `Setup`_
* `Engine Configuration`_
* `Improving Speech Recognition Accuracy`_
* `Limitations`_
* `Engine API`_


Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three Pocket Sphinx engine dependencies:

- `sounddevice <https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io>`_
- `pyjsgf <https://github.com/Danesprite/pyjsgf>`_
- `sphinxwrapper <https://github.com/Danesprite/sphinxwrapper>`_

You can install these by running the following command::

  pip install 'dragonfly[sphinx]'


If you are installing to *develop* Dragonfly, use the following instead::

  pip install -e '.[sphinx]'


**Note for Linux:** You may need the ``portaudio`` headers to be
installed in order to be able to install/compile the ``sounddevice``
Python package.  Under ``apt``-based distributions, you can get them by
running ``sudo apt install portaudio19-dev``.  You may also need to make
your user account a member of the ``audio`` group to be able to access
your microphone.  Do this by running ``usermod -a -G audio
<account_name>``.

Once the dependencies are installed, you'll need to copy the
`dragonfly/examples/sphinx_module_loader.py`_ script into the folder
with your grammar modules and run it using::

  python sphinx_module_loader.py


This file is the equivalent to the 'core' directory that NatLink uses
to load grammar modules.  When run, it will scan the directory it's in
for files beginning with ``_`` and ending with ``.py``, then try to
load them as command-modules.


Engine configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine can be configured by changing the engine configuration.

You can make changes to the ``engine.config`` object directly in your
*sphinx_engine_loader.py* file before :meth:`connect` is called or
create a *config.py* module in the same directory using .

The ``LANGUAGE`` option specifies the engine's user language. This is
English (``"en"``) by default.

Audio configuration
............................................................................


Audio configuration options are used to record from the microphone and
to validate input wave files.

These options must match the requirements for the acoustic model being
used.  The default values match the requirements for the 16kHz CMU US
English models.

- ``CHANNELS`` -- number of audio input channels (default: ``1``).
- ``SAMPLE_WIDTH`` -- sample width for audio input in bytes
  (default: ``2``).
- ``FORMAT`` -- should match the sample width (default: ``int16``).
- ``RATE`` -- sample rate for audio input in Hz (default: ``16000``).
- ``BUFFER_SIZE`` -- frames per recorded audio buffer (default: ``1024``).


Decoder configuration
............................................................................

The ``DECODER_CONFIG`` object initialised in the engine config module
can be used to set various Pocket Sphinx decoder options.

The following is the default decoder configuration:

..  code:: Python

    import os

    from sphinxwrapper import DefaultConfig

    # Configuration for the Pocket Sphinx decoder.
    DECODER_CONFIG = DefaultConfig()

    # Silence the decoder output by default.
    DECODER_CONFIG.set_string("-logfn", os.devnull)

    # Set voice activity detection configuration options for the decoder.
    # You may wish to experiment with these if noise in the background
    # triggers speech start and/or false recognitions (e.g. of short words)
    # frequently.
    # Descriptions for VAD configuration options were retrieved from:
    # https://cmusphinx.github.io/doc/sphinxbase/fe_8h_source.html

    # Number of silence frames to keep after from speech to silence.
    DECODER_CONFIG.set_int("-vad_postspeech", 30)

    # Number of speech frames to keep before silence to speech.
    DECODER_CONFIG.set_int("-vad_prespeech", 20)

    # Number of speech frames to trigger vad from silence to speech.
    DECODER_CONFIG.set_int("-vad_startspeech", 10)

    # Threshold for decision between noise and silence frames.
    # Log-ratio between signal level and noise level.
    DECODER_CONFIG.set_float("-vad_threshold", 3.0)


There does not appear to be much documentation on these options
outside of the `Pocket Sphinx config_macro.h`_ header file.

The easiest way of seeing the available decoder options and their
default values is to initialise a decoder and read the log output ::

    from sphinxwrapper import PocketSphinx
    PocketSphinx()


Changing Models and Dictionaries
............................................................................

The ``DECODER_CONFIG`` object can be used to configure the
pronunciation dictionary as well as the acoustic and language models.
You can do this with something like::

  DECODER_CONFIG.set_string('-hmm', '/path/to/acoustic-model-folder')
  DECODER_CONFIG.set_string('-lm', '/path/to/lm-file.lm')
  DECODER_CONFIG.set_string('-dict', '/path/to/dictionary-file.dict')

The language model, acoustic model and pronunciation dictionary should
all use the same language or language variant.  See the `CMU Sphinx
wiki`_ for a more detailed explanation of these components.


Improving Speech Recognition Accuracy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMU Pocket Sphinx can have some trouble recognizing what was said
accurately.  To remedy this, you may need to adapt the acoustic model that
Pocket Sphinx is using.  This is similar to how Dragon sometimes requires
training.  The CMU Sphinx `adaption tutorial`_ covers this topic. There is
also this `YouTube video on model adaption`_ and the `SphinxTrainingHelper`_
bash script.

Adapting your model may not be necessary; there might be other issues with
your setup.  There is more information on tuning the recognition accuracy in
the CMU Sphinx `tuning tutorial`_.


Limitations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine has a few limitations, most notably with spoken language support
and dragonfly's :class:`Dictation` functionality.


Dictation
............................................................................

Mixing free-form dictation with grammar rules is difficult with the CMU
Sphinx decoders.  It is either dictation or grammar rules, not both.  For
this reason, Dragonfly's CMU Pocket Sphinx SR engine supports speaking
free-form dictation, but only on its own.

Parts of rules that have required combinations with :class:`Dictation` and
other basic Dragonfly elements such as :class:`Literal`, :class:`RuleRef`
and :class:`ListRef` will not be recognized properly using this SR engine
via speaking.  They can, however, be recognized via the :meth:`engine.mimic`
method, the :class:`Mimic` action or the :class:`Playback` action.


Unknown words
............................................................................

CMU Pocket Sphinx uses pronunciation dictionaries to lookup phonetic
representations for words in grammars, language models in order to recognize
them.  If you use words in your grammars that are *not* in the dictionary, a
message similar to the following will be printed:

  *grammar 'name' used words not found in the pronunciation dictionary: 
  notaword*

If you get a message like this, try changing the words in your grammars by
splitting up the words or using to similar words, e.g. changing "natlink" to
"nat link".  You may also try to add words to the pronunciation dictionary.


.. _RefSphinxSpokenLanguageSupport:

Spoken Language Support
............................................................................

There are a only handful of languages with models and dictionaries
`available from Source Forge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/Acoustic%20and%20Language%20Models/>`_,
although it is possible to build your own language model `using lmtool
<http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html>`_ or
pronunciation dictionary `using lextool
<http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lextool.html>`_.
There is also a CMU Sphinx tutorial on `building language models
<https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutoriallm/>`_.

I have tested Russian and Chinese models and dictionaries with this engine
implementation.  They both work, though the latter required recompiling
CMU Pocket Sphinx with the ``FSG_PNODE_CTXT_BVSZ`` constant manually set to
6 or higher.  There may be encoding errors, depending on Python version and
platform.


Dragonfly Lists and DictLists
............................................................................

Dragonfly :class:`Lists` and :class:`DictLists` function as normal, private
rules for the Pocket Sphinx engine.  On updating a Dragonfly list or
dictionary, the grammar they are part of will be reloaded.  This is because
there is unfortunately no JSGF equivalent for lists.
