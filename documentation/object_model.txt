Object model
****************************************************************************

The core of Dragonfly is a language object model revolving around three 
object types: grammars, rules, and elements. This section describes that 
object model.

Grammars
============================================================================

A :ref:`grammar <RefGrammar>` is a collection of rules. It manages the 
rules, loading and unloading them, activating and deactivating them, and 
it takes care of all communications with the speech recognition engine. 
When a recognition occurs, the associated grammar receives the 
recognition event and dispatches it to the appropriate rule. 

Normally a grammar is associated with a particular context or 
functionality.  Normally the rules within a grammar are somehow 
related to each other.  However, neither of these is strictly 
necessary, they are just common use patterns.

The :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.grammar_base.Grammar` class and derived 
classes are described in the :ref:`RefGrammarClasses` section.


.. _RefObjectModelRules:

Rules
============================================================================

:ref:`Rules <RefRules>` represent voice commands or parts of voice 
commands. Each rule has a single root :ref:`element 
<RefObjectModelElements>`, the basis of a tree structure of elements 
defining how the rule is built up out of speakable parts. The element 
tree determines what a user must say to cause this rule to be 
recognized. 


.. _RefObjectModelRulesExported:

Exported rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules can be exported or not exported. Whether a rule is exported or not 
is defined when the rule is created. 

Only exported rules can be spoken directly by the user. In other words, 
they form the entry points into a grammar, causing things to happen 
(callbacks to be called) when appropriate words are recognized. 

WSR distinguishes between top-level rules, which can be recognized 
directly, and exported rules, which can be referenced from rules in 
other grammars. NatLink doesn't allow inter-grammar rule referencing and 
uses exported to refer to directly recognizable rules. Dragonfly follows 
NatLink in functionality and terminology on this topic. 

Properties of exported rules:

 * Exported rules are known as a top-level rules for WSR
   (``SRATopLevel``).
 * Exported rules can be spoken by the user directly.
 * Exported rules can be referenced from other rules within
   the same grammar.
 * Exported rules can be referenced from rules in other grammars
   (only possible for WSR).
 * Exported rules can be enabled and disabled to receive recognitions
   or not (:meth:`~dragonfly.grammar.rule_base.Rule.enable`,
   :meth:`~dragonfly.grammar.rule_base.Rule.disable`).
 * Exported rules have callbacks which are called when recognition
   occurs (:meth:`~dragonfly.grammar.rule_base.Rule.process_begin`,
   :meth:`~dragonfly.grammar.rule_base.Rule.process_recognition`).

Non-exported rules cannot be recognized directly but only as parts of 
other rules that reference them. 

Properties of non-exported rules:

 * Non-exported rules can't be spoken by the user directly.
 * Non-exported rules can be referenced from other rules within
   the same grammar.
 * Non-exported rules can't be referenced from rules in other
   grammars (never possible for DNS).


.. _RefObjectModelRulesImported:

Imported rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules can be imported, i.e. defined outside the grammar referencing 
them, or not imported, i.e. defined within the grammar. Whether a 
rule is imported or not is defined when the rule is created. 

NatLink in general doesn't allow rules from one grammar to be imported 
into another grammar, i.e. inter-grammar rule referencing. However, it 
does provide the following three built-in rules which can be imported: 

 * ``dgnletters`` -- All the letters of the alphabet for spelling
 * ``dgnwords`` -- All words active during dictation
 * ``dgndictation`` -- A special rule which corresponds to free-form
   dictation; imported by Dragonfly for its
   :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Dictation` element


.. _RefObjectModelElements:

Elements
============================================================================

Elements are the basic building blocks of the language model. They 
define exactly what can be said and thereby form the content of rules. 
The most common elements are: 

 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Literal`
   -- one or more literal words
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Sequence`
   -- a series of other elements.
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Alternative`
   -- a choice of other elements, only one of which can be said
   within a single recognition
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Optional`
   -- an element container which makes its single child element
   optional
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.RuleRef`
   -- a reference to another rule
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.ListRef`
   -- a reference to a list, which is a dynamic language element which
   can be updated and modified without reloading the grammar
 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_basic.Dictation`
   -- a free-form dictation element which allows the speaker to say
   one or more natural language words

The above mentioned element types are at the heart of 
Dragonfly's object model.  But of course using them all the time 
to specify every grammar would be quite tedious.  There is 
therefore also a special element which constructs these basic 
element types from a string specification:

 * :class:`~dragonfly.grammar.elements_compound.Compound`
   -- a special element which parses a string 
   spec to create a hierarchy of basic elements.
