Test suite
****************************************************************************

The Dragonfly library contains tests to verify its functioning and
assure its quality.  These tests come in two distinct types:

 * Tests based on `unittest <http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html>`_.
 * Tests based on `doctest <http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html>`_;
   these also serve as documentation by providing usage examples.

See the links below for tests of both types.

Tests in doctests format:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   test_grammar_elements_basic_doctest
   test_grammar_elements_compound_doctest
   test_grammar_list_doctest
   test_recobs_doctest
   test_action_base_doctest
   test_word_formatting_v10_doctest
   test_word_formatting_v11_doctest


Tests based on the unittest framework reside in the :mod:`dragonfly.test`
package.

Running the test suite
============================================================================

Using DNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the following steps to run the test suite for the DNS backend Aland

 #. Start DNS.  (And ensure that NatLink is also automatically started.)
 #. Extract the Dragonfly source code in a directory ``<dir>``.
 #. Run the tests with the following commands:

    * ``cd <dir>``
    * ``C:\Python26\python.exe <dir>\setup.py test``

Using WSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the following steps to run the test suite for the DNS backend Aland

 #. Start WSR.
 #. Wake WSR up, so that it is *not* in sleeping state, and then turn the
    microphone *off*.  (It is important to wake the microphone up first,
    because otherwise it'll be off and sleeping at the same time.  This
    causes all recognitions to fail.  Weird, huh?)
 #. Extract the Dragonfly source code in a directory ``<dir>``.
 #. Run the tests with the following commands:

    * ``cd <dir>``
    * ``C:\Python26\python.exe <dir>\setup.py test --test-suite=dragonfly.test.suites.sapi5_suite``
