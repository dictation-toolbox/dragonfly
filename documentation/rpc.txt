Remote Procedure Call (RPC) sub-package
============================================================================

Dragonfly's remote procedure call (RPC) sub-package allows for interaction
with a dragonfly speech recognition engine running in a remote process. This
is useful for building responsive GUI applications without having to
integrate them into a loaded grammar or grammar rule.

Some use cases for this framework include:

- Listing available commands and grammars in the current context.
- Integrating and displaying documentation.
- Guiding the user through complex commands.
- A GUI for building dragonfly/third-party grammars.
