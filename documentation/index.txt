Dragonfly
============================================================================

Dragonfly is a speech recognition framework. It is a Python 
package which offers a high-level object model and allows its 
users to easily write scripts, macros, and programs which use 
speech recognition.

It currently supports the following speech recognition engines:

 - *Dragon NaturallySpeaking* (DNS), a product of *Nuance*
 - *Windows Speech Recognition* (WSR), included with Microsoft 
   Windows Vista, Windows 7, and freely available for Windows XP
 - *CMU Pocket Sphinx* (with caveats)

Usage example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very simple example of Dragonfly usage is to create a static 
voice command with a callback that will be called when the 
command is spoken.  This is done as follows: ::

   from dragonfly.all import Grammar, CompoundRule

   # Voice command rule combining spoken form and recognition processing.
   class ExampleRule(CompoundRule):
       spec = "do something computer"                  # Spoken form of command.
       def _process_recognition(self, node, extras):   # Callback when command is spoken.
           print("Voice command spoken.")

   # Create a grammar which contains and loads the command rule.
   grammar = Grammar("example grammar")                # Create a grammar to contain the command rule.
   grammar.add_rule(ExampleRule())                     # Add the command rule to the grammar.
   grammar.load()                                      # Load the grammar.

The example above is very basic and doesn't show any of 
Dragonfly's exciting features, such as dynamic speech elements.

Rationale behind Dragonfly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dragonfly offers a powerful and unified interface to developers 
who want to use speech recognition in their software. It is used 
for both speech-enabling applications and for automating 
computer activities.

In the field of scripting and automation, there are other 
alternatives available that add speech-commands to increase 
efficiency. Dragonfly differs from them in that it is a powerful 
development platform. The open source alternatives currently 
available for use with DNS are compared to Dragonfly as follows:

 - Vocola uses its own easy-to-use scripting language, 
   whereas Dragonfly uses Python and gives the macro-writer all 
   the power available.

 - Unimacro offers a set of macros for common activities, 
   whereas Dragonfly is a platform on which macro-writers can 
   easily build new commands.
