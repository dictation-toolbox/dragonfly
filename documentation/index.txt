Dragonfly
============================================================================

Dragonfly is a speech recognition framework for Python that makes it
convenient to create custom commands to use with speech recognition
software. It was written to make it very easy for Python macros, scripts,
and applications to interface with speech recognition engines. Its design
allows speech commands and grammar objects to be treated as first-class
Python objects.

Dragonfly can be used for general programming by voice. It is flexible
enough to allow programming in any language, not just Python. It can also be
used for speech-enabling applications, automating computer activities
and dictating prose.

Dragonfly contains its own powerful framework for defining and executing
actions. It includes actions for text input and key-stroke simulation. This
framework is cross-platform, working on Windows, macOS and Linux (X11 only).
See the :ref:`actions sub-package documentation <RefActions>` for more
information, including code examples.

This project is a fork of the original
`t4ngo/dragonfly <https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly>`__ project.

Dragonfly currently supports the following speech recognition engines:

 - :ref:`Dragon NaturallySpeaking <RefDNSInstall>` (DNS), a product of
   *Nuance*. All DNS versions up to 15 (the latest) should be supported.
 - :ref:`Windows Speech Recognition <RefWSRInstall>` (WSR), included with
   Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows 7+, and freely available for Windows XP
 - :ref:`Kaldi <RefKaldiEngine>` (under development)
 - :ref:`CMU Pocket Sphinx <RefSphinxEngine>` (with caveats)

Dragonfly's documentation is available online at
`Read the Docs <http://dragonfly2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
Dragonfly's FAQ is available in the documentation :ref:`here <RefFAQ>`.
There are also a number of Dragonfly-related questions on `Stackoverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-dragonfly>`_, although
many of them are related to issues resolved in the latest version of
Dragonfly.

Usage example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very simple example of Dragonfly usage is to create a static 
voice command with a callback that will be called when the 
command is spoken.  This is done as follows: ::

   from dragonfly import Grammar, CompoundRule

   # Voice command rule combining spoken form and recognition processing.
   class ExampleRule(CompoundRule):
       spec = "do something computer"                  # Spoken form of command.
       def _process_recognition(self, node, extras):   # Callback when command is spoken.
           print("Voice command spoken.")

   # Create a grammar which contains and loads the command rule.
   grammar = Grammar("example grammar")                # Create a grammar to contain the command rule.
   grammar.add_rule(ExampleRule())                     # Add the command rule to the grammar.
   grammar.load()                                      # Load the grammar.

Say *do something computer* and ``Voice command spoken.`` will be printed in
the Natlink messages window. If you're not using Dragon, then it will be
printed into the console window.

The example above is very basic and doesn't show any of 
Dragonfly's exciting features, such as dynamic speech elements.


Rationale behind Dragonfly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dragonfly offers a powerful and unified interface to developers 
who want to use speech recognition in their software. It is used 
for both speech-enabling applications and for automating 
computer activities.

In the field of scripting and automation, there are other 
alternatives available that add speech-commands to increase 
efficiency. Dragonfly differs from them in that it is a powerful 
development platform. The open source alternatives currently 
available for use with DNS are compared to Dragonfly as follows:

 - Vocola uses its own easy-to-use scripting language, 
   whereas Dragonfly uses Python and gives the macro-writer all 
   the power available.

 - Unimacro offers a set of macros for common activities, 
   whereas Dragonfly is a platform on which macro-writers can 
   easily build new commands.
