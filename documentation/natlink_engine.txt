.. _RefNatlinkEngine:

Natlink and DNS engine back-end
============================================================================

The Dragonfly library may be used with Nuance's Dragon NaturallySpeaking
(DNS) speech recognition software for Microsoft Windows.   Dragonfly
interacts with DNS through another piece of software called Natlink.

This is the engine of choice on Microsoft Windows.


Requirements and Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three requirements for using Dragonfly's Natlink/DNS engine
back-end: Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows, Natlink and a 32-bit Python
installation.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking, or simply Dragon, is available for purchase from
Nuance Communications, Inc.  For the latest version, see
`www.nuance.com/dragon.html <https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html>`__.
Natlink and Dragonfly support Dragon versions up to 16, the latest.  The
*Individual* editions of *Dragon* are recommended, although other editions
such as *Home* will also work.  Editions of Dragon for macOS are not
compatible with Natlink or Dragonfly.

Natlink is available for download from GitHub and SourceForge.  The required
version depends on which version of Python is installed.  If you are using
Python 2, please download and install one of the older versions of Natlink,
available from the project's `SourceForge page
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlink4.2/>`__.
If you are using Python 3, please download and install one of the newer
versions of Natlink, available from the project's `GitHub releases page
<https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink/releases>`__.

Please see the `Natlink install instructions
<https://dictation-toolbox.github.io/natlink/#/install>`__ for how to
install Natlink on your machine and configure it.

A 32-bit Python installation is required to use this engine back-end.  This
is because Natlink does not work with 64-bit Python.  This limitation is
unlikely to be overcome.


Post-install Use
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Natlink is up and running, Dragonfly command-modules can be
treated as any other Natlink macro files.  Natlink automatically
loads macro files from a predefined directory **or** from the
optional user directory.  Common locations are:

 * ``C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem``
 * ``C:\Program Files\NatLink\MacroSystem``
 * ``My Documents\Natlink``

At least one of these, or the custom user directory, should be present
after installing and configuring Natlink.  That is the place where you
should put Dragonfly command-modules so that Natlink will load them.
Command-modules should be Python source files starting with an underscore,
e.g. *_notepad_example.py*.

Don't forget to turn the microphone off and on again after placing new
command-modules in the Natlink directory, because otherwise Natlink does
not immediately see the new file.

The Natlink/DNS engine may also be used via the :ref:`command-line interface
<RefCLI>`.


Engine Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This engine can be configured by passing (optional) keyword arguments to
the ``get_engine()`` function, which passes them to the engine constructor
(documented below). For example:

.. code:: Python

   engine = get_engine("natlink",
     retain_dir="natlink_recordings",
   )

The engine can also be configured via the :ref:`command-line interface
<RefCLI>`:

.. code:: shell

   # Initialize the Natlink engine back-end with custom arguments, then load
   # command modules and recognize speech.
   python -m dragonfly load _*.py --engine natlink --engine-options \
       retain_dir="natlink_recordings"
